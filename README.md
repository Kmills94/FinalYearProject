# Project
Final year project

user.XAML/XAML.cs is the server
root.XAML/XAML.cs is the client
MainWindow.XAML/XAML.cs is the login form
Chat.XAML/XAML.cs is used by the client

MyInterface.cs
MyRemotableClass.cs  used by both client and server, supplies the methods for the client/server to call

project is missing comments and uses some magic numbers and non-standard naming conventions, this was due to time constraints
